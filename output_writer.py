output_writer.py
-----------------
Shared row model + JSON/CSV writers used by all three engines.

Three modes, one row shape
--------------------------
    --mode listings  work.mercor.com/explore           the marketplace index
    --mode job       work.mercor.com/jobs/{id}/{slug}  one marketplace listing
    --mode careers   www.mercor.com/careers            Mercor's OWN hiring

`listings` and `job` are two views of one thing, keyed by the same
`listingId`, which is what lets a `job` run enrich a `listings` run and what
`diff_runs.py` joins on. What they populate is genuinely different, and that
is why `data_source` is a COLUMN rather than a sidecar field: an `explore`
row carries the site's category (`domain`), the slot counters and
`posted_at`; a `detail` row carries `company_website`,
`company_description`, `available_spots`, `active_contractors_count` and a
currency. Neither is a subset of the other.

Checked field by field on 2026-09-18, the same job read both ways: **zero
disagreements** on the 37 fields both publish. So `diff_runs.py` comparing
an `explore` run against a `detail` run is comparing like with like on every
shared column — which is exactly what `source_changed` exists to keep
honest where it is not.

`careers` is the OTHER population
---------------------------------
Mercor the marketplace sells contract work; Mercor the company hires
salaried employees, and publishes those through Ashby on a different host
with a UUID id space that shares nothing with a `list_…` id. The rows fit
this dataclass — they are job postings with a title, a pay range and a
location — but the two sets have no key in common and comparing them would
produce a diff whose every line is an artefact. So `mode` goes in the
sidecar and `diff_runs.py` REFUSES a cross-population comparison, which is
CLAUDE.md §9's rule for a repo that reads more than one kind of thing.

The row is `JobPosting` and not `Product`
-----------------------------------------
Every shop repo in this family names its row `Product` and keeps the
commerce columns even where they are null, because on a shop a null price
is a fact worth recording. Mercor sells no products: there is no price, no
currency on a product, no discount, no stock and no brand, and six columns
null on every row of every run of every mode is exactly what §9 says must
not exist. `wellfound-scraper`, `bbb-scraper` and `quora-scraper` are the
precedent.

What a job board has where a shop has a price is a RANGE, which is two
columns and not one, plus a PERIOD that is not always hourly — measured
across the 390 listings on 2026-09-18: hourly 347, per-task 31, one-time 9,
yearly 3. `rate_min`/`rate_max`/`rate_currency`/`rate_period` are those four
facts, and the careers route's own rendered string is kept verbatim beside
them in `compensation` so a consumer can always see what was published.

What IS kept, byte-identical and in order, is the family prefix — `source`,
`scraped_at`, `url`, `sku`, `title` — so one column name works across the
family and a consumer reading several of these repos reads the same first
five columns in the same order (§9).

Twenty-one columns that are absent, and the measurement
-------------------------------------------------------
The `/explore` record has 50 fields and 21 of them hold ONE distinct value
across all 390 listings: `matchQuality`, `submittedOn`, `userSimilarityScore`,
`searchSimilarityScore`, `applicationStepsCompleted`, `applicationStepsPending`,
`prequalifiedListing`, `isRecommended`, `hourlyPayRate`, `companyLogo`,
`companyAlias`, `interviewDuration`, `interviewScheduleLink`,
`interviewSchedulingEnabled`, `disableApplications`, `autoRedirectToApply`,
`isPrivate`, `isMostRecent`, `deletedAt`, `offersEquity` and `status`
itself on that route. Most are logged-in personalisation that an anonymous
fetch always sees as null or zero.

They are not columns. §9: a column that is null on every row of every run
should not exist, and removing one needs the measurement written down so
someone can add it back with a better one. Two exceptions are carried
anyway and the reason is in each field's comment: `status`, because a
DETAIL page can publish a closed listing where `/explore` only ever shows
active ones, and `offers_equity`, because the careers route publishes real
equity components on 98 of 145.

`rating` is absent, and that one is a measurement too
-----------------------------------------------------
Mercor publishes no rating, score or review count for a listing, a company
or a contractor on any route this scraper reads: zero such fields across
390 listing records, 7 detail captures and 108 careers records in the
2026-09-18 captures. The nearest thing is `userSimilarityScore`, which is 0
on every anonymous row and is a match score for the logged-in viewer rather
than a rating of anything. A `rating` column would be null on every row of
every run.

Everything below the dataclass is row-class-agnostic: pass `row_cls` so an
empty CSV still gets the right header for the mode that produced it.

      partial  — rows were gathered, then the run stopped early
      failed   — nothing was gathered at all

    `mode` and `source` are recorded because `mode` is not implied by the
    repo: the same output prefix can hold a listings run, a job run or a
    careers run, and those populate different columns — a listings row has
    the site's `domain` and its slot counters, a job row has the company
    website and a currency, a careers row has a department and an Ashby
    apply URL. `diff_runs.py` refuses a pair whose modes or sources differ,
    which matters more here than on most sites in this family: a careers run
    and a marketplace run have NO ids in common at all, so a diff of the two
    would report every row as both added and removed.

    `source` is `mercor.com` on every row of every run. The site is served
    on two hosts (`work.mercor.com` and `www.mercor.com`) and this column
    names the SITE rather than the host, so one value covers both; which
    host a row came from is recoverable from `url`. It is kept because
    consumers read these columns by name across the family.

    `extra` carries facts about the run that are not about any single row.
    Mercor publishes no catalogue total on any route, so unlike a site that
    states `totalResults` there is no figure to copy — what goes in instead
    is the run's OWN coverage arithmetic: `records_in_payload` and
    `urls_in_itemlist` for a listings run (390 and 326 on 2026-09-18, and
    the gap is why the parser reads the React Query cache), and
    `jobs_enumerated`/`jobs_fetched` for a job run.

    That is the only honest way to say what a run holds here, because
    "complete" and "exhaustive" come apart on this site: a `--mode listings`
    run fetches everything `/explore` serves — genuinely complete — while
    `/explore` held 390 of the 462 listings the sitemap and the index
    enumerate between them. Nothing in the row count reveals that.

    `pages_failed` lists the pages that did not yield data, by number.
    `pages_completed` alone was enough only while pages were fetched strictly
    in order, where "3 of 10 completed" could only mean 1-2-3: a count is not

# Stop reasons that mean the run saw everything there was to see. Anything
# else ended the page loop early, so the result is only a partial view.
#
# "no_new_products" belongs here and "pagination_exhausted" is kept for the
# engines that still stop on a missing next-link: the first is a property of
# the DATA (a page contributed nothing not already seen, so the listing is
# over), while the second is a property of a CSS SELECTOR and is therefore
# the weaker signal — a renamed attribute looks identical to a short
# catalogue.
#
# On Mercor there is no third signal, and that is not a gap: there is
# nothing for one to do. `/explore` and `/careers` each hold their whole
# result set in one response, so a run cannot walk off an end that does not
# exist, and `--mode job` plans from a finite enumerated list rather than
# from a `?page=N` convention — asking for more pages than the list holds
# is capped by `page_flow.pages_to_plan`, not discovered by overshooting.
#
# So the stop reasons a sibling repo needs for that — "page_cap_reached"
# and "page_echo_mismatch" — are carried in the tuple below for the family's
# shared vocabulary and cannot fire here. They are left in rather than
# pruned so that all repos in this family name the same states.
#
# "single_page_route" is complete by construction AND by measurement:
# `/explore` and `/careers` each serve their whole result set in one
# response, and every pagination parameter tried on `/explore` returned a
# byte-identical payload (2026-09-18). A run that stopped after one fetch
# fetched the whole route.
#
# Note what it does NOT mean: `/explore` holds 390 of the 462 listings
# Mercor publishes, so a complete `--mode listings` run is still a slice.
# CLAUDE.md §21 — complete and exhaustive are different words — and the
# sidecar records both figures so a consumer is not left inferring one from
# the other.
