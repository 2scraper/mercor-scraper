diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old mercor.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new mercor.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run kept under a dated filename, diffed against
the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --mode listings --out "mercor_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "$(ls -t mercor_????-??-??.json | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "mercor_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new: the listing was
                   filled or withdrawn, or simply fell outside the pages this
                   run fetched
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different title, rate range,
                   pay period, commitment, work arrangement, location, or
                   slot count. See TRACKED_FIELDS.
  source_changed — sku present in both, but one row came from the INDEX
                   (`explore`) and the other from a DETAIL page (`detail`),
                   and they differ on a column only one of the two fills.
                   Reported separately because this says something about our
                   own two snapshots rather than about the listing — and
                   --fail-on-change deliberately ignores it.

TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE READING A DIFF OF THIS SITE
-----------------------------------------------------
**`removed` does not mean filled.** `/explore` is not the whole site: it
held 390 of the 462 listings the sitemap and the index enumerate between
them on 2026-09-18, and the 72 it omits are live jobs. So a listing can
leave a `--mode listings` file because it left the INDEX, not because
anything happened to the job — and a `--mode job` run bounded by `--pages`
holds a slice of the enumeration for the same reason. Two runs are only
comparable as a census when both covered the same ground; `--mode job
--pages 462` is what "the same ground" means here.

Mercor publishes no catalogue total on any route, so there is no site-stated
figure to drift — what a run records instead is its own coverage
(`records_in_payload`, `jobs_enumerated`, `jobs_fetched`).

**`position` and `page` are deliberately not tracked, and here that is a
choice rather than a necessity.** Unlike a sibling site whose serialisation
order wanders between requests, Mercor's `/explore` order was measured
STABLE on 2026-09-18: three fetches about ten seconds apart returned the
identical 390 ids in the identical order, 0 positions differing.

So a position change on this site would be a real change and not noise —
and it is still not diffed, for a reason worth stating rather than
inheriting. Ten seconds is evidence about ten seconds. It says nothing
about whether the ranking is stable across a night, which is the interval
a nightly diff actually spans, and a column that reports churn on every run
teaches a reader to ignore the diff. If someone measures the overnight case
and finds it stable, tracking `position` becomes a defensible change; until
then this is the conservative default and the measurement above is what a
future decision should be argued from.

A row this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.

# What is worth watching on a Mercor listing, and nothing else.
#
# EVERY NAME HERE MUST EXIST ON THE ROW CLASS, and that is not a style rule.
# This tuple arrived from the repo this one was ported from and named 25
# fields, 21 of which `JobPosting` does not have — so the diff compared
# nothing, and a listing whose rate went from 100 to 999 with its status
# changed to `closed` reported "0 changed" and exit 0. A price monitor that
# cannot see a price change is worse than no price monitor, because it
# reports success. `smoke_test.py` now pins every name against the dataclass.
#
# A shop's fields are absent because a job has no price, stock or discount —
# porting them would be dead code that looks load-bearing (CLAUDE.md §4).
# What changes on a Mercor listing is its PAY, its TERMS, its ELIGIBILITY
# and the client behind it.
#
# `eligible_locations` and `eligible_residence_locations` are lists and
# compare element-wise, which is what you want: a role opening up to a new
# country is a real change.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT TRACKED, and this one is a measurement rather than an
# oversight — the live supply counters:
#
#     remaining_slots  supplied_slots  available_spots
#     active_contractors_count  recent_candidates_count
#
# They move on their own. Two `--mode listings` runs a few minutes apart on
# 2026-09-18 already differed on one: `remaining_slots` 30 -> 29 and
# `supplied_slots` 0 -> 1, because a contractor was supplied in between.
# Tracking them would make every nightly diff report hundreds of "changes"
# that are the marketplace working normally, and a diff that is always noisy
# is one nobody reads. They are still COLUMNS — a consumer who wants supply
# telemetry has it — they are simply not what `changed` is for.
#
# Also not tracked: `position`, `page`, `scraped_at`, and `data_source`
# (which drives `source_changed` instead). See the module docstring.
