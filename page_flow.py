page_flow.py
------------
The retry / solve / blocked decision, as DATA rather than as three copies of
an if-chain.

Mercor answers a request five ways, and four of them want a different
response:

    a page whose __NEXT_DATA__ holds records         -> parse
    a page whose __NEXT_DATA__ holds none            -> parse, it is an answer
    HTTP 404, or the site's own not-found copy       -> stop, it is not a block
    a page we could not find a payload in            -> parse_error, dump it
    something else entirely                          -> wait, then retry

Three copies of that triage across three engines would drift, and the drift
would be silent — one engine reporting exit 3 where its twin reports exit 0
on the same response.

There is no fifth state for a challenge on this site because, measured on
2026-09-18, Mercor rendered none: eighteen candidate vendor markers counted
across seven captures, all zero, and identical 200s from `curl`, from
`python-requests` and from an empty User-Agent. `blocked` is in the policy
table anyway — an ungated site today is not an ungated site forever, and a
run should be able to say "blocked" rather than "empty" on the day that
changes.

Nothing here imports a browser, and **no JavaScript crosses this boundary**:
Selenium's `execute_script` takes a function BODY with an explicit `return`
while Playwright and pyppeteer take `() => expr`, so a shared snippet would
quietly acquire one driver's dialect. The callbacks below are named for the
OPERATION instead, and each engine spells it in its own dialect.

# `> 1` on purpose: waiting for ONE match resolves on
# something unrelated — a nav link, a footer — long before the grid is really
# there.
#
# Four, and the ceiling on this number is lower than it looks. `/explore`
# holds 390 records in its payload and paints only **15** anchors into the
# served markup: the grid is virtualised, so the DOM never shows the whole
# catalogue however long anything waits for it. A readiness threshold
# anywhere near the record count would time out on every single run.
#
# Which is the other half of why this is a readiness signal ONLY. The rows
# come out of `__NEXT_DATA__`, which is complete in the first response, so a
# page whose grid has not painted at all still parses to all 390 rows — and
# the engines therefore do not gate parsing on this.
MIN_CARD_MATCHES = 4

# Anchored on a URL pattern, never a CSS class: Mercor's classes are
# build-generated Tailwind strings that churn on every deploy, while
# `/jobs/list_…` is a contract with search engines.
#
# TWO spellings, and the second one is the whole reason this selector is
# not the obvious one-liner. **Hydration rewrites every job anchor.**
# Mercor server-renders `href="/jobs/list_{id}/{slug}?returnPath=/explore"`
# and React then replaces it with `href="/explore?listingId={id}"`, a
# same-page modal route. So, measured in a live headless Chromium on
# 2026-09-18:
#
#     a[href*="/jobs/list_"]        15 in the served HTML, 0 in the live DOM
#     a[href*="listingId=list_"]     0 in the served HTML, 16 in the live DOM
#     the two together              16 at domcontentloaded and every poll after
#
# The single-spelling version is the kind of mistake that does not look
# like one: the rows still come out right, because they are read from
# `__NEXT_DATA__` and not from the DOM. What it costs is invisible in the
# output and expensive everywhere else — the readiness wait can never be
# satisfied, so every page burns its full timeout, and the captcha gate
# sees "zero content on this page" and decides a detected challenge is
# BLOCKING. On the first live run of this engine that turned mercor's
# background reCAPTCHA v3 into "attempting to solve" on a page holding all
# 390 rows; with an API key set, that is a charge per page for nothing
# (detected is not blocking, and never pay for a challenge that is not
