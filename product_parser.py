product_parser.py
-----------------
Everything this repo knows about Mercor. The engines are site-agnostic apart
from a handful of named constants; if you are adding site knowledge anywhere
else, it belongs here (CLAUDE.md §1).

What Mercor publishes, and where
--------------------------------
Mercor runs two different things under one brand, on two hosts, and this
scraper reads three routes across them:

    --mode listings  work.mercor.com/explore              the marketplace index
    --mode job       work.mercor.com/jobs/{id}/{slug}     one marketplace listing
    --mode careers   www.mercor.com/careers               Mercor's OWN hiring

The first two are two views of ONE thing — a contract role on the Mercor
marketplace, keyed by the same `listingId` — which is what lets a `job` run
enrich a `listings` run and what `diff_runs.py` joins on. The third is a
different population entirely: salaried employment at Mercor the company,
served off a different host out of the Ashby ATS, with its own id space. It
shares the row shape and nothing else, so `diff_runs.py` refuses to compare
a careers run against a marketplace one (CLAUDE.md §9).

The structured source is the React Query cache, NOT the JSON-LD
--------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE.md §15 step 2 says to count the JSON-LD blocks before writing a line.
Counted on the 2026-09-18 captures, `/explore` carries three — a
`BreadcrumbList`, an `Organization`, and an `ItemList` of 46 KB. The
`ItemList` looks like the primary path and is the wrong one twice over:

  * it carries **URLs only** — `@type: ListItem`, `position`, `url`. No
    title, no pay, no location. Every field would have to come from a
    second fetch per job.
  * it is **incomplete**. 326 URLs against 390 records in the same
    response's `__NEXT_DATA__`, and the 64 it drops are not random: all 55
    `evergreen` listings plus 9 standard ones. Anchoring on it silently
    loses 16% of the catalogue, which is §8's "fail loudly" failing
    quietly.

So the primary path is the Next.js `__NEXT_DATA__` payload, specifically the
dehydrated React Query cache at

    props.pageProps.dehydratedState.queries[0].state.data.listings

which held 390 complete records in a single 1.5 MB response. The JSON-LD is
still read, but only on a DETAIL page and only for the two things the React
Query object does not state: the currency, and the schema.org employment
type. See `_row_from_jsonld`.

`__NEXT_DATA__` carries a `nonce`
---------------------------------
    <script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" nonce="x50vDK…">

A regex written as `<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">`
misses every page on this site. It cost twenty minutes here before the
attribute was noticed, and it is the kind of miss that reads as "the site
stopped server-rendering" rather than as a typo. `_NEXT_DATA_RE` tolerates
any attributes in any order.

No single route enumerates the catalogue
----------------------------------------
Measured 2026-09-18. Neither of the two enumeration sources contains the
other:

    /explore  __NEXT_DATA__   390 listings
    /sitemap.xml              447 job URLs
    shared                    375
    sitemap only               72   -- all `status: active`, live detail pages
    explore only               15
    union                     462

Three sitemap-only listings were fetched to check what they were, and all
three answered 200 with `role.status == "active"`: they are live jobs that
`/explore` simply does not show. So `--mode job` enumerates the UNION and
says so in the sidecar, and a `listings` run is honest about being a
390-of-462 slice. This is CLAUDE.md §21's "complete and exhaustive are
different words", with the twist that here neither source is the superset.

`/explore` has no pagination at all
-----------------------------------
`?page=2`, `?limit=10`, `?offset=100` and `?domain=Finance` were each tried
against `/explore` on 2026-09-18 and every one returned a byte-identical
payload (the only size difference is the query string echoed back into the
canonical `<link>`). The route ships the entire set in one response. So
`page_url()` refuses to build a page URL for it rather than manufacturing
duplicates and reporting a complete multi-page run holding page 1 several
times (§7, §18).

In `--mode job` a "page" IS one job detail page. That is not a stretch of
the flag: a job URL is the unit this site addresses independently, it is
exactly what the concurrency machinery wants, and it makes the sidecar's
"which pages failed by number" meaningful. `--pages 462` fetches the lot.

Traps that cost time here
-------------------------
* **JSON-LD `unitText` is not the pay period.** On 3 of 40 randomly
  sampled detail pages (2026-09-18) `baseSalary.value.unitText` said
  `HOUR` while the record's own `payRateFrequency` said `per-task`. The
  React Query field is the one to trust; `unitText` is normalised for
  Google's job schema and is wrong for anything non-hourly.
* **JSON-LD drops non-hourly pay entirely.** The `one-time` fixture has
  `rateMin == rateMax == 60` in the record and NO `baseSalary` node at
  all. A parser anchored on JSON-LD reports that job as unpaid.
* **`validThrough` is not an expiry.** It read `2026-10-18` on 40 of 40
  sampled pages, fetched on 2026-09-18 — render time plus thirty days,
  computed per request. It says nothing about the listing and is not
  carried as a column.
* **21 of the record's 50 fields are constant across all 390 listings**
  and are not carried: `matchQuality`, `submittedOn`, `userSimilarityScore`,
  `applicationStepsCompleted` and the rest are logged-in personalisation
  that an anonymous fetch always sees as null or zero. §9 — a column null
  on every row of every run should not exist. The measurement is here so
  someone can add one back with a better one.
* **Currency is measured, not assumed.** USD on 40 of 40 sampled
  marketplace detail pages, but the careers route publishes GBP on 4 of
  145 salary components. Nothing defaults to USD anywhere in this file.

Detection: there is nothing to detect
-------------------------------------
Eighteen candidate bot-challenge markers were counted across three page
kinds on 2026-09-18 — `cf-turnstile`, `challenges.cloudflare.com`,
DataDome, PerimeterX, Incapsula, Akamai, `errors.edgesuite.net`, AWS WAF,
reCAPTCHA in both spellings, hCaptcha, `data-sitekey`, `<captcha-widgets>`
and the rest. Every one was **zero**. Identical 200s came back from `curl`,
from `python-requests` and from an EMPTY User-Agent, and twelve rapid
sequential detail fetches were all 200 at ~0.4s each. Mercor is not gated,
at least from a Hetzner datacentre address (AS24940, Helsinki) on that date.

`BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS` is therefore deliberately SHORT rather than
deliberately broad. Per §18 a marker that fires on a page the site plainly
served is worse than no marker, and per §8/§19 `cf-turnstile` is measured
useless in any repo that can reach the Scraping Browser, whose auto-solve
extension injects it into every page it loads. It is not here.

And the positive-asset trick does NOT work on this site
-------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE.md §8 and §18 recommend "was this built out of the site's own
assets?" as the structural signal, proven on two other sites. Counted here
it is **backwards**: `/_next/static` appears 23-27 times on every real page
and **32 times on the 404**, because Mercor's not-found page is the same
Next.js app. A threshold on it would classify the one page that is
genuinely not content as the most content-like page on the site.

What works instead is an unambiguous positive signal, which §17 says to
check before any heuristic anyway: **a real page carries `__NEXT_DATA__`
and the 404 carries none at all**. `references_own_assets` is kept for the
engines' interface and is documented as the weak signal it is here.

    """One `/explore` response: its rows, and what it says about itself.

    The same shape every engine in this family expects from a listing
    parser, so the engines stay byte-identical across repos. Three of these
    fields are constants on this site rather than readings, and saying so
    here is cheaper than three engines each discovering it:

      * `pages_available` is 1. `/explore` has no second page (see
        `page_url`), so the index is always complete in one response.
      * `page_repeated` is always False. It exists because some sites in
        this family answer a request for page 48 of a 47-page listing with
        page 1 again under HTTP 200; Mercor cannot, having only one page.
      * `total_companies` is None. Mercor paginates over nothing and
        publishes no company count — 99 of 390 listings name a company at
        all.

    `records_in_payload` and `urls_in_itemlist` are the two views the
    response has of itself, and the gap between them (390 against 326 on
    2026-09-18) is the measurement that justifies reading the React Query
    cache instead of the JSON-LD. A run RECORDS both rather than a later

# `cf-turnstile` is NOT here, on purpose. It is the obvious marker for a
# Turnstile and it is measured useless in any repo that can reach the
# Scraping Browser: 2Captcha's auto-solve extension injects
# `data-ts-input="cf-turnstile-response"` into every page it loads, so it
# fires on good pages, and it was absent from two real Cloudflare
# challenges in sibling repos (§8, §19). `challenges.cloudflare.com` is the

    classification-order trap stated as code: **order the signals by how
    much they prove, not by how cheap they are.** A sibling repo checked a

    exit 3 for a correct answer.

    1. A payload with records in it is `content`. Nothing overrides it —
       not a status code, not a marker. A page that gave us the rows IS
       the content, and this site's one measured false positive risk runs
       the other way (see `references_own_assets`).
    2. A vendor challenge marker is `blocked`. Unambiguous, and nothing on
       this site has ever matched one.
    3. HTTP 404, or the site's own not-found copy, is `not_found` — a real
       answer about a real question, not a failure to fetch.
    4. A payload with NO records is `empty`: the site served us a page and

       empty index, which is worth reporting as exit 4 rather than
       retrying forever.
    5. A page carrying no `__NEXT_DATA__` at all, under any other status,

       means the site sent us something substantial we could not read,
